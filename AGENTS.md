# BIG 2 Project

## DEV Rules
- Do work only according to the ask
- Prevent changing code which is not related to the ask

## Login session
- NEVER store any runtime data in local cache, except the logged-in email address
- Once logged in, retrieve the setting from firebase and default in main screen, alongside the score; if none retrieved just default
- After clicking start game button, save the settings into firebase
- After every game finished, save the record into firebase
- During development, everytime adding any new attributes to be stored in firebase, update the firebase rule automatically

## Screen General
- Prevent scrollbar whenever possible
- Maintain landscape mode and portrait mode separately, and make sure both works
